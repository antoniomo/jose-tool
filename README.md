# JWT tool

Command line tool to manage your JWT, JWK and JWK sets.

I did it simply to fulfill my needs on a quick and dirty way, on top of the
awesome `https://github.com/lestrrat-go` and taking a lot of inspiration and
code from `https://github.com/square/go-jose/tree/v2/jose-util` as well, but if
there's issues or suggestions I can add functionality or polish the interface.

## A disclaimer

Googling a bit, I found that the name of a similar tool already exists in the
node world:

- https://github.com/phish108/node-jose-tools

Even though this one has nothing to do with that one, given that the scope is
similar please contact me if you want me to change the name.
